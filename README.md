# Natter
A very basic PHP forum built with [Netcrafter](https://github.com/chriskempson/netcrafter). 

**NOTE:** Currently a Work in Progress!

## Why?
I wanted a very basic forum but the so called lightweights were not light enough!

No database, no setup, no admin panels. Should rely on directory structure for forum organisation (categories, topics). Management tasks (e.g. user management, forum management) should be possible through the editing of files.

Curiously, all of the data (posts, users) is stored in JSON files.
